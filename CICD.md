# CI/CD


Continuous Integration(CI):
The practice of frequently building, testing and merging code changes into a shared repo.
**Allows developers to detect integration issues early and maintain a consistent codebase.
Conitnuous Delivery (CD): Unsures that code changes can be deployed to prod. at any time but requeires manual approval.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Automatically deploys code changes to production without manual intervention.

## CI/CD in ML

Data dependency: Data versioning and management strategies.
Experimentation: Automating hyperparameter tuning.
Model Versioning: Improving collaoration.
Testing Paradigm: Goes beyond traditional functional and unit testing.
Continuous Deployment Challenges: Complexities in model serving, monitroing and updates.

# GitHub Actions (GHA)

Checkout -> Env. Setup -> LINT & TEST -> Build -> Deploy

*Event*: is a specific acitivity in a repository that triggers a workflow run.
Push, Pull request, opening a issue
*Workflow*: automated process that will run one or more jobs.
Defined in YAML files, triggered automatically by event (manual run possible)

housed in .github/workflows, multiple workflows can be defined.

*Steps*: individual units of work.
Executed in order, depends on previous step
Run on the same machine, so data can be shared
Unit of work examples:
Compiled code application, shell script.

complex but frequently repeated tasks can combine
(Checkout repo, comment on PR)

*Job*: set of steps.
Each job is independent.
Parallel execeution is possible.
Executed on the compute machine called runners.

## Intermediate YAML 

Represents multiline strings or blocks of text
- Code snippets (shell commands)
- Paragraphs (logs)
- Configuration files
  
### Style indicators - letral

*Literal style* (|) preserves line break and identation
Useful for writing shell commands
commands: |
  echo "Running script"
  R script.R

*Fold style* (>) removes line breaks
Useful for writing wrapped messages like paragraphs
message: >
  lorem ipsum lorem 
  ipsum lorem.

### Chomping indicators
Control the behaviour of newlines at he end of the string
added after the style indicators

*clip* default mode single line at the end
No additional symbol needed for representation

*strip*(-) removes all newlines at the end
*keep* (+) retains all newlines at the end

### Dynamic value injection

Expressions allow parser to dynamically substitute values
Usage:
  ENV variables
  Ref other parts of YAML
${{ ... }}
database:
  host: ${{ config.database.host }}

Multi-document YAML

###Â Example
config:
  slack:
    channels:
      - workflow-orchestration
      - builds-911

workflow:
   #Use the correct block style indicator 
   #while writing commands to run
  run: |
    echo "Running script.py"
    python3 script.py
  notify:
    - slack:
        # Reference the Slack channels using 
        # placeholder defined in config block
        channels: ${{ config.slack.channels }}
        # Use the correct block style indicator 
        # to send the message without newlines
        message: >-
          It appears that your run has failed.
          To gain more insights into the failure,
          it is recommended to examine the CI logs.
